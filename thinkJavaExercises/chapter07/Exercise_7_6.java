/**
 * Think Java v.6 - Exercise 7.6
 *
 * One way to evaluate e^(-x^2) is to use the infinite series expansion:
 *    e^(-x^2) = 1 - 2x + 3x^2/2! - 4x^3/3! + 5x^4/4! - ...
 *
 * In other words, we need to add up a series of terms where the ith term is
 * equal to ((-1)^i)(i+1)x^i/i!. Write a method named gauss that takes x an n
 * as arguments and returns the sum of the first n terms of the series. You
 * should not use factorial or pow.
