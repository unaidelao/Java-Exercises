/*
 * Think Java v.6 - Exercise 1.2
 *
 * Before you do anything else, find out how to compile and run a Java program.
 * Some environments provide sample programs similar to the example in Section 1.4.
 *
 * 1. Type in the hello world program, then compile and run it.
 *
 * 2. Add a print statement that displays a second message after the
 * “Hello,World!”. Say something witty like, “How are you?” Compile and run the
 * program again.
 *
 * 3. Add a comment to the program (anywhere), recompile, and run it again. The
 * new comment should not affect the result.
